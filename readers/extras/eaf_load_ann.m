function [Ann, status, Fvar] = eaf_load_ann(Fname)% [Ann, status, Fvar] = eaf_load_xxx(Fname)%% eaf_load_xxx() is a subprogram to eaf_load that is used to specifically% load annotations from an EMGlab ".xxx" annotation file into% the EMGlab annotation structure.  The function inputs and outputs% are standardized so that different annotation formats can be facilitated% by different functions with names of the form: eaf_load_xxx, where% xxx generally denotes the filename extension of the annotation file.% See eaf_load() for complete definitions of Fname, Ann, status and Fvar.% If output variable Fvar is unused, then it should be set to [].%% At a minimum, Ann must return the fields Ann.time and Ann.unit,% as defined in the EMGlab annotation structure.  Be sure to close any% files that were opened, even if errors occur.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Format: EMGlab ann File%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ".ann" file is ASCII with two columns: times in seconds and spike ID% numbers.  This file type is intended as a temporary, simple file type% and may not be supported in future EMGlab releases.  Instead, EMGlab% annotation file (EAF) format will be supported.Fvar = [];  % Unused output variable, but must be supplied.Ann = [];if ~exist(Fname, 'file')  status = (['File "' Fname '" not found']);   return; endfid = fopen (Fname, 'rt');if fid<0;   status = (['Problem opening ', Fname]);   return; end;[data, n] = fscanf (fid, '%g');if n==0 | 2*round(n/2)~=n;   status = ([' Problem reading ', Fname]);  return;end;Ann.time = data(1:2:end);Ann.unit = data(2:2:end);status = '';
